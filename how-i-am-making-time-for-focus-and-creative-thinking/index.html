My passion is fueled by something very simple – it helped me. After 3 months, I feel more in control of my workday and better about the quality of my contributions. The amount of time I am spending “catching up” on weekends has decreased. </p><p>Intuitively, we know there is a need to understand and better manage our time, and data from McKinsey, the National Statistics Council and the University of Chicago supports this:</p><p> •High skill knowledge workers spend 28% of their work week managing email </p><p>•47% of meeting time is seen as unproductive </p><p>•1/3rd of executives believe their time is poorly spent </p><p> My experiment started with a curiosity about the Delve Analytics Dashboard sparked by a webcast given by Becky Thielen. After using Delve Analytics for a few weeks and looking at things like the amount of time I spend in meetings and my response time to emails, three things jumped out: </p><p>•I spend a lot of time reading and responding to emails. And when I say a lot - it was about 14 hours a week, or almost two whole work days.</p><p> •I leave tasks that need focus like solving complex problems, planning, reviewing and writing to hours of the day where I know I am not at my best. </p><p>•I cheat myself out of the white space time needed to spark creative thinking. </p><p> Much like the data a personal fitness tracker might give you – Delve Analytics showed me where the issues are but it was up to me to make changes. Shocked into action by how little focus time I was getting, I started with three simple actions. </p><p>1. Block time - Not always possible and not easy, but I block time to allocate adequate brain time to review, write and to think during the morning when I am at my best. This has been the hardest to implement and while I have reduced the amount of time spent in meetings overall during my prime thinking time, it has been difficult and I am not yet where I want to be.</p><p> 2. Sort, ping, call - I began this believing that it was rude to not read or respond to each email, but have come to recognize the volume I get is simply too great. Now, I prioritize using a simple high, medium and low rank and am happy to report low gets read last and not that often. I use IM to answer quick questions and I (gasp) use the phone to get to closure fast without the “reply all” email chain of pain. I have reduced the amount of time spent on email by about half. </p><p>3. Commit time for new – In order to do what I do well, I know my brain needs exposure to different ideas. When my days are chock full, I tend to sacrifice this critical part of my day. Now, I read or watch something that is not related to anything marketing or Microsoft every weekday. Committing 10 minutes to watch a TED talk (today’s was on Education and Creativity) or browse Medium is my investment in feeding the part of my brain that thinks differently. I can’t measure the impact on my Delve Analytics dashboard, but I can tell you I feel better about the quality of my contributions and my overall engagement. </p><p> Using the insight from Delve Analytics and committing to change has allowed me to take ownership of my time. Based on my experience with a fitness tracker, I suspect I am still in the initial obsession phase and some of my attention to the Delve dashboard will fade over time. But much like the 10,000 steps that have become part of my daily routine, I think these new habits are becoming part of my every day. My next step is to examine who I am spending time collaborating with and which relationships I am investing in. </p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="18"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="19"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="20"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="21"><span data-reactid="22"><!-- react-empty: 23 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="24"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="25">How I am making time for focus and creative thinking</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="26"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="27"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="28"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
